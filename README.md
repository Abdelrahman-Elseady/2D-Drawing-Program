# 2D Drawing Program

This is a feature-rich 2D drawing application built with a graphical user interface and mouse interaction. It supports drawing and clipping of various shapes using fundamental computer graphics algorithms. The project also integrates a console for extended control and includes file I/O support for saving and loading artwork.
